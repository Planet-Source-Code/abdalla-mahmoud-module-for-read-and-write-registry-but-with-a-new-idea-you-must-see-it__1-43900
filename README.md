</div>

### Description

Hi All .. This is a module that is read and write registery .. Im sure you have one better than mine .. But If you use Windows XP , You can not Delete a Registery Key that's Include SubKeys .. For Eample You Can not Say :

Call RegDeleteKey(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,"MyKey1\MyKey2\MyKey3")

It Will Make Nothing .. So You Will Have To Delete ("MyKey3") First then ("MyKey2") .etc ..

But In This Module You Will Be Able To Delete a Key and all It's SubKeys In Window XP ..

This Module Incude Other Functions Yo Will need With Registery ..

Please Comment and Vote For Me :Q)
